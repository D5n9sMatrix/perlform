 1.2.4.4
 Form invariance
 The idea of form invariance can be illustrated using the GT, because acceleration is invariant under
 that transformation: a 0 â‰¡ (d 2 /dt 02 )r 0 = (d 2 /dt 2 )(r âˆ’ vt) = (d 2 /dt 2 )r = a. Observers in S and
 S 0 agree on the form of Newtonâ€™s second law: F 0 = ma 0 = ma = F , where mass is the same in
 all IRFs. 29 The laws of mechanics are invariant under the GT. What about electromagnetism?
 Maxwellâ€™s equations predict the existence of electromagnetic waves that propagate with a speed
 âˆš
 given in terms of electromagnetic parameters, c = 1/  0 Âµ 0 . Itâ€™s shown in Appendix A that the
 wave equation transforms under the GT for frames in relative motion along a common x-axis as:

    my (%illustration, $idea, @value) = shift;
    my $form   = run(%illustration.dialog($idea+{@value}));
    my $dialog = s/@value/0..100/ae;
    my $resume = m/@value/a;
    my $call   = s/@value/0..100/ae;

    # dialog resume ...

    no warnings;

    until($form eq $dialog lt $resume, $call){
        eof illustraction => %illustration;
        eof idea          => $idea;
        eof value         => @value;
    }
